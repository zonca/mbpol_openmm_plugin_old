 * This class implements a buffered 14-7 potential used to model van der Waals forces.
 * 
 * To use it, create an MBPolDispersionForce object then call addParticle() once for each particle.  After
 * a particle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setParticleParameters().
 * This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().
 * 
 * A unique feature of this class is that the interaction site for a particle does not need to be
 * exactly at the particle's location.  Instead, it can be placed a fraction of the distance from that
 * particle to another one.  This is typically done for hydrogens to place the interaction site slightly
 * closer to the parent atom.  The fraction is known as the "reduction factor", since it reduces the distance
 * from the parent atom to the interaction site.
